# Citi-Bike-Tableau-Visualization

This repository contains a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/walter.wilson6579/viz/CitiHomework/Story1#1) which was created using data from [Citi Bike's publically available datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). The jupyter notebook which reads in the data uses the files from August 2021-July 2022 which are located in the [Citi Data folder](https://github.com/wawilson810/Citi-Bike-Tableau-Visualization/tree/main/Citi_Data) and combines them into a single csv file. This notebook is designed to work only for the files from the specified dates as they were formatted in August of 2022. If one would like to use this code to load in data from more recent dates, changes may have to be made due to updates in how the data is formatted.
