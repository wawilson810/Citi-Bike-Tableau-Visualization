# Citi-Bike-Tableau-Visualization

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that is meant to process data downloaded from [Citi Bike's publically available datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) to be used in this [Tableau project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/walter.wilson6579/viz/CitiHomework/Story1#1). The notebook reads in the data from files from August 2021-July 2022 which are located in the [Citi Data folder](https://github.com/wawilson810/Citi-Bike-Tableau-Visualization/tree/main/Citi_Data) and combines them into a single csv file. This notebook is designed to work only for the files from the specified dates as they were formatted in August of 2022. If one would like to use this code to load in data from different dates, changes may have to be made due to discrepancies in formatting.
